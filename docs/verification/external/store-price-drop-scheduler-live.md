# Store price-drop scheduler live Evidence

Gate: `store-stripe-live`
Artifact: `docs/verification/external/store-price-drop-scheduler-live.md`

> Template only. No external evidence has been captured yet; leave proof rows unchecked until live evidence is attached and redacted.

## Required Environment Names

- `SUPABASE_URL` set in the external run environment
- `PRICE_DROP_NOTIFY_SECRET` set in the external run environment

## Required Proof Checklist

Leave each item unchecked until the external run evidence is captured and redacted. `pnpm external:evidence:preflight` accepts checked `- [x]` rows only in the artifact assigned to that proof.

- [ ] Hosted price-drop scheduler writes fresh run evidence.

## Capture Handoff

Use these operator handoffs to collect redacted live evidence before checking proof rows. Handoffs are guidance only; they do not execute commands or satisfy preflight by themselves.

- Hosted price-drop scheduler writes fresh run evidence.: Run `pnpm hosted:deploy-gate:scheduler-packet`, capture redacted scheduler dashboard/config proof, then run the price-drop scheduled lane and collect `OGL_HOSTED_CRON_EVIDENCE_CHECKS=price-drop pnpm hosted:cron-evidence:artifact-hints` for the redacted `store_price_drop_notification_runs` row with `notify-price-drop`, `scheduled`, `dry_run=false`, and `completed`; artifact hints fill Gate-Specific Evidence only and do not satisfy the proof row by themselves. Evidence cues: `price-drop`, `store_price_drop_notification_runs`.

## Proof Evidence Mapping

When a proof row is checked, fill the matching evidence line with a specific redacted run ID, dashboard link, external artifact locator, workflow ID, signed log, or `sha256:<64-hex>` reference. Accepted dashboard URL hosts are Supabase, Stripe live Dashboard, GitHub Actions/releases/deployments, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, App Store Connect, Google Play Console, Firebase, and OneSignal; otherwise use `run:`/`artifact:`/`sha256:` style locators. Generic text such as `redacted`, `see above`, local files, localhost URLs, and example URLs do not satisfy preflight.
Proof evidence values must name the proof lane they support, for example `stripe-webhook`, `stripe-tax-invoice`, `price-drop`, `presence-poll`, `account-deletion`, `mod.io/CurseForge`, `presence-bridge`, `catalog-cloud-transfer`, `achievement-cache`, `overlay`, `backup-restore`, `client-mount-apply`, `community-rollout`, `controller-profile-sync`, `plugin-marketplace`, `mobile-push`, or `hosted-deploy`; bare `evt_...` values are accepted only for the Stripe webhook signature proof. Syntactically specific but generic IDs such as `run-generic-1` stay blocked. Compound proof values must include every required term in the same value: mod-provider evidence includes both `mod.io` and `CurseForge`; external-drive backup/restore proof evidence and hardware matrix evidence include `Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux`.

## Gate-Specific Evidence

Fill these rows with concrete external values for this gate. Keep secrets redacted; values must still include a specific accepted locator or ID containing digits, such as `run:...`, `probe-...`, `session-...`, `workflow-...`, `deployment-...`, or `artifact-...`; lane-specific hosted cron collector IDs such as `price-drop-cli-scheduled` are accepted for hosted cron Run ID rows, and Stripe webhook event IDs must be bare `evt_...` values.
Expected hosted cron values: `Hosted cron table: store_price_drop_notification_runs`, `Function: notify-price-drop`, `Scheduled: scheduled`, `dry_run=false: false` or `confirmed false`, and `Status: completed`.

- Hosted cron table:
- Function:
- Run ID:
- Scheduled:
- dry_run=false:
- Status:

## Lane-Specific Evidence

- none

## Evidence Captured

Preflight requires non-empty, non-placeholder values for each evidence detail field below. `Captured at` must be a freshly captured current UTC ISO-8601 timestamp within 30 days and not more than 10 minutes in the future. `Release ref` must name the release tag, `Commit SHA` must be a full 40-hex commit, and release CI requires them to match `GITHUB_REF_NAME` and `GITHUB_SHA` exactly. `Redaction notes` must use positive wording such as `raw secrets removed`, `tokens redacted`, or `no raw secrets`; contradictory wording such as `not redacted`, `unredacted`, `contains raw`, or `not reviewed` is rejected. Local `docs/verification/screenshots/*` paths, `file://` URLs, localhost/loopback/private-network URLs, and `example.com` URLs do not satisfy external completion evidence.

## Secret Handling

Operator reminders only. Preflight enforces this boundary by scanning artifact content for secret-shaped values.

- Raw provider keys, Stripe secrets, bearer tokens, JWTs, Supabase service-role/auth/access tokens, scheduler secrets, mobile push/provider secrets, private keys, device tokens, and webhook secrets are absent.
- Logs and screenshots are redacted before this artifact is committed.
